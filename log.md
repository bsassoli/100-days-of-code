# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 20, 2020


**Today's Progress**: Started a mini todo list in Python for keeping track of progress with the nwe house in XL using `openpyxl`

**Thoughts:** Nice to get started working with XL files. Thought about implementing classes for rooms and todos. Maybe I can start making a micro-gui with Tkinter?

**Link to work:** [Scarlatti](scripts/scarlatti.py)
