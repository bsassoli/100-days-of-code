# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 20, 2020


**Today's Progress**:
- Started a mini todo list in Python for keeping track of progress with the nwe house in XL using `openpyxl`.
- Finished _Basic HTML and HTML5_ in www.freecodecamp.org's _Responsive Web Design Certification_

**Thoughts:** Nice to get started working with XL files. Thought about implementing classes for rooms and todos. Maybe I can start making a micro-GUI with Tkinter?

**Link to work:**
- [Scarlatti](scripts/scarlatti/)

### Day 1: June 21, 2020


**Today's Progress**:
- MITx 6.00
  - Finished PSSET 2 in MITx 6.00x (bisection search)
  - Finished FEX2 (again, bisection and recursion)
  - Started PSET 3
- Started _Basic CSS_ in _Responsive web design_ certification on www.freecodecamp.org. Currently **@ 35%**.

**Thoughts:**
- Recursion always bogs me...
- SO PROUD OF [THIS](/scripts/MITx%206.00x%20Intro%20To%20CS/W3/ps3_hangman.py) ONE LINER! :smile::fire::fire::clap:
