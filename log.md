# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 20, 2020


**Today's Progress**:
- Started a mini todo list in Python for keeping track of progress with the nwe house in XL using `openpyxl`.
- Finished _Basic HTML and HTML5_ in www.freecodecamp.org's _Responsive Web Design Certification_

**Thoughts:** Nice to get started working with XL files. Thought about implementing classes for rooms and todos. Maybe I can start making a micro-GUI with Tkinter?

**Link to work:**
- [Scarlatti](scripts/scarlatti/)

### Day 1: June 21, 2020


**Today's Progress**:
- MITx 6.00
  - Finished PSSET 2 in MITx 6.00x (bisection search)
  - Finished FEX2 (again, bisection and recursion)
  - Finished PSET 3
- Started _Basic CSS_ in _Responsive web design_ certification on www.freecodecamp.org. Currently **@ 50%**.

**Thoughts:**
- Recursion always bogs me...
- SO PROUD OF [THIS](/scripts/MITx%206.00x%20Intro%20To%20CS/W3/ps3_hangman.py) ONE LINER! :smile::fire::fire::clap:

### Day 2: June 21, 2020


**Today's Progress**:
- MITx 6.00.1: Finished FEX3 (dictionaries)
- Finished _Basic CSS_ in _Responsive web design_ certification on www.freecodecamp.org. Started _Applied Visual Design_ and currently **@35%**.

**Thoughts:**
- I really need to setup a text editor/IDE that I like for good!
- Need to start learning (and working!) with **virtual environments**.

### Day 3: June 22, 2020


**Today's Progress**: Lagging behind....


### Day 4: June 23, 2020


**Today's Progress**: Another day of lagging behind. Worked a little on `scarlatti`

**Thoughts:** I wonder whether it makes any sense to do the `scarlatti` thing with Tkinter. And I should start learning to use Flask and Django. It's probable that my choice of XL is a bad idea. Nice idea of <u> using dictionaries to call functions based on user input </u>.


### Day 5: June 24, 2020


**Today's Progress**:
- Spent a lot of time in _Complete Python Web Course: Build 8 Python Web Apps_. Developed a few apps. Git started with pycharm and vens.

**Thoughts:**
- Get back out from tutorial purgatory.

**Thoughts:**
